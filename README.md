# Self_Driving_Car
The goal of the project is to train a Deep Neural Network to replicate the human steering behavior while driving, thus being able to drive autonomously on a simulator.
The network takes as input the frame of the frontal camera ( a roof-mounted camera) and will predict the steering direction at each instant.
